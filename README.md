# Frontend Order Application: Built with Next.js and Material UI
* [Preview](https://orders-frontend.vercel.app/)
## Project Description
Build an application which is able to:
1. Show to the user all orders sorted by creation date, showing the photo and some information nearby
2. Allow the user to filter by the attributes: Status, Size, Condition and Type
3. Create an api endpoint that will allow a user or machine to create, and update an order

## Technologies used:
* [Next.JS](https://nextjs.org/)
* [Material UI](https://mui.com/)
* [Vercel](https://vercel.com/)

## Setup
The Go API will need to be run prior to the frontend application to seed the data.
